OS API hasn't changed in ten years.
Node API changes every month.
How to navigate that change?
API is a poor acronym for what we are doing (REST API).
Impact of change to API depends on number of users.
If huge user base, huge impact on developers.
Motivation for bumping API V1 to V2 to V3 is bad initial design.
But a good design can suffer due to new demands from organization.
API developers dictate without acting as consumers.
Need to drive more from consumer's need.
Developer driven APIs often fail, lead to V2, V3.
Don't just assume it is another engineer consuming the API.
Sometimes devs put in API for testing, then ship it as product.
APIs expose internals.
Hackers will try to inject garbage.
Node allows devs to build highly concurrent systems.
Microservices bring complexity, queuing.
How do these come together?
Cognitive load, complexity, tire fire.
You have product design, app design, you need a team design.
But that is an idealistic view.
Building team, knowledge, extremely hard.
Many Node devs don't understand how Node works.
Education problem.
Bitterness of reality, can't always do the new thing.
Engineers, divide and conquer.
But what is the cost of making everything distributed?
PayPal doesn't do a lot of microservices.
Still in investigation phase.
What will be solved?
The negative aspects of REST are consistently underestimated.
REST for REST's sake.
How often do you write API calls?
Usually not that many.
So RPC not so bad versus REST.
