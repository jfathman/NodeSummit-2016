JavaScript's Current and Future Role in IoT

IoT.
Everything will be connected.
50B connected devices by 2020.
Correlation does not imply causation.
One percent rule.
Compute is added when < 1 % of product cost.
Disposable compute, essentially free.
IoT languages, Java, C, JavaScript, Python, C++.
JavaScript all the way down.
Espruino interprets JavaScript code on chip.
Samsung JerryScript compiles JavaScript to bytecode for better performance.
Flasher.js.
Espruino starting to see community growth.
Espruino web IDE, Chrome add-on.
REPL over serial to device.
Supports setInterval().
Much simpler than C equivalent.
Can get better performance than hand-crafted C code.
All the asynch benefits of Node/JavaScript architecture.
Automatic power management.
Extended compute model, JavaScript dominates.
Firmata protocol, based on MIDI.
Johnny-Five.
Arduino.
Why extended compute?
Easy, easy, easy.
Compute modules: Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison, Tessel2.
Node.js first.
Lots of Python at this layer.
Intel Edison, OTA updates.
Precision increases closer to chip.
Linux, Node GC, non-deterministic timing.
Embedded JavaScript not mature yet.
Not used in production.
But experiment with it.
Embedded JavaScript needs community.
Server-side IoT is built on Node.
Mosca MQTT broker.
Noble package for Bluetooth on Node (Sandeep Mistry).
Node-Red.
IoT payloads similar to web.
Async, event loop, scaling.
The future is standards.
IoT is like the Internet before web.
Need free and standardized way to exchange data between disparate connected devices.
Need two standards:
  - Device to cloud, the wild west.
  - Cloud to cloud, solved, REST, JSON.
MQTT, HTTP, CoAP, STOMP.
Two prominent surfacing:
  MQTT
    - Bidirectional pub/sub, lightweight.
    - Good for device to device.
  WebSockets
    - Heavier, overhead of HTTP.
    - Good for device to cloud.
    - Broad support.
    - No concept of pub/sub, add yourself.
Mosca MQTT, pluggable pub/sub and data stores.
Bold claims for future:
Linux and Node.js based compute modules will replace majority of microcontrollers.
RPi Zero $5.
NodeMCU $5.
Omega2 $5, Linux with Wi-Fi.
JSON all the way down.
MQTT or HTTP?
