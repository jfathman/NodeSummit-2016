Definitions of community.
Fellowship with others, sharing of values.
Joint ownership (or liability).
All are invited.
Get involved in Node.
You are the elite.
Share what you learned.
Node started in GitHub generation.
Invited to participate, contribute.
You feel like Node is yours.
Node community very responsive, lots of help.
Good place to go when you want to make something.
Why don't you just help?  We need you.
What is the Node community?
We want to see Node succeed.
The way to do that is to help.
Different than any other community.
Willing to stop what they're doing and help you.
Community versus enterprise Node.
Approach things in a different way.
How do we make everyone feel included?
But it's okay for individuals to not be ready for a larger community experience.
Still about making connections with people.
Retrospective on Node community.
We are facilitating diversity.
The time it takes to support community is very demanding.
Node project is very discussion focused.
But people often don't have time to participate.
Employers could carve out time to support sharing.
Start small, internal communities.
Lunch and learn, build bonds.
There is this sense - other people get to do that.
Nodeschool, Nodebots, attracts new people.
Events pull people together.
We need to do much more than that.
Teacher training, workshops.
Enable other teachers.
Node is a worldwide project.
How do you combine cultures/values so everyone feels welcome?
Future of Node.
You can be a mentor wherever you are in your knowledge/understanding.
Someone will be extremely grateful for your help.
That is one of the most rewarding things in life.
Be excited and welcome other people too.
