Getting to Green: Node.js Core Testing

In Node project, number one cause of test flakiness is timers, setTimeout().
Timers are not guaranteed to fire at specific time.
Test might be reliable on OS X, but not on another OS.
Some Linux distros have variant IPv6 config and behaviors.
localhost is not defined on IPv6, ::1 is IPv6 localhost address.
Took six months to get CI green for Node.
Especially flaky on Windows.

Understaffed, volunteers.
Need OS X servers for test.
Test coverage.

Great way to get involved in Node core.
Best shape we've ever been in for test.
But lots of work to be done.
