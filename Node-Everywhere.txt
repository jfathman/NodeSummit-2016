Node.js is fastest growing open source platform in the world.
More than 300K modules.
Nobody wants to write all their code from scratch.
400 new packages every day.
4.5 million users, 100% growth per year.
At any time, half the users just used Node this year.
Why is Node so popular?
Thinking in terms of verticals not accurate.
Web, API, IoT, desktop, only Node ties all this stuff together well.
Apache Cordova, Node.js mobile.
Desktop apps with Node.js was a surprise.
Slack, Visual Studio.
IoT devices, great IoT community since day one.
Node didn't run on device itself originally.
But now, has Node on the device, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone.
APIs and microservices.
Serverless, Node is supported, first supported language or only supported language.
Barrier to entry getting lower.
Node comes into these places.
We make programming environments accessible.
